                Training a dog to be left alone can be stressful. It impacts many areas of an owner's life, requiring consistency, commitment, and patience.

                We provide tailored training sessions to guide owners through training their dogs in a calm and caring way. To do this we take the guesswork out of training by providing a thoroughly researched guide that breaks down training into easy-to-follow exercises.

                A common pitfall of training is that it is easy for owners to become frustrated or feel progress is stagnating. To overcome this we provide an overview of progress making it easy to see how much has been achieved. Also, we understand every dog is different, and sometimes this requires professional help. We work with professionals who are on hand to support you with personalized guidance.

                The course has five levels. Each level is aimed at a different stage of training. The first two levels focus on treating separation anxiety by normalizing the common triggers that cause your dog to be anxious before leaving the house. After this training focuses on more general leave training.

                This module teaches the dog to stay settled when the owner is moving around the house. It starts by settling the dog where they will be left then slowly de-sensitizing them to movements around them.

                This section focuses on common departure triggers to keep your dog calm when preparing to leave.  These include common triggers such as putting on a coat, getting keys, or packing a bag.

                Here we focus on lots of short absences to build up trust. The exercises consist of training a prompt when leaving such as "Bye" or "Be good". The session includes seven exercises, six being short leaves with a longer leave at the end. At this point, it is advised to stay local to the house to be available to come back if the dog becomes anxious.

                Now we increase the difficulty by leaving the house for longer. The sessions consist of four exercises, three shorter leaves, and a single longer leave. Think picking up a coffee from a local cafe or visiting the local shop. We also wind down the number of exercises to start to have a more natural approach to leaving the house.

                The final level, here we ramp up the increments we leave for. The sessions consist of three exercises, two short leaves, and a longer leave. Think visiting local cafes, going to the gym, seeing friends, etc. We also further lower the number of exercises but increase their durations.

                Recently separation anxiety has become more prevalent. As with all training consistency is key, and as often owners dealing with this issue struggle daily with daycares, keeping a social life, and other commitments.

                <b>Increase adherence to training:</b> A lot of time owners can give mixed signals on how well training is going and you may start questioning the approach you have recommended. By being able to monitor the client's progress you can focus less on adherence and more on ways to improve the quality of the sessions with tailored advice.
              </p>

                <b>Support owners by showing progress:</b> With this type of training, there will be highs and lows. There is no silver bullet to this problem and a bad session can bring owners down which is more likely to make the issue worse. By having a history of progress owners can be more confident that they are making progress.
