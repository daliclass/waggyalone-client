Only by building positive associations can we start to make progress with training our dog that being alone is not scary!

                <li>Moving towards the door</li>
                <li>Putting shoes/coat on</li>

              <p
                class="is-medium content"
              >To do this, completing these actions without leaving the house until the dog does not associate these actions with you leaving. This starts by doing these actions in the same room, getting closer to leaving as the course continues.</p>
