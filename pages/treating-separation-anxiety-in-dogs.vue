                Training a dog that suffers from separation anxiety can be a daunting task. 53% of dog owners in the US believe that their dog has separation anxiety when left alone, with 61% saying their dog's exhibit signs of stress when leaving the house

              <p class="is-medium content">
                Some common signs of separation anxiety include:
              </p>
              <ul class="content is-medium">
                <li>Barking</li>
                <li>Scratching doors</li>
                <li>Pacing</li>
                <li>Excessive chewing of household furniture</li>
              </ul>

                These nuisance behaviours are unpleasant for both owners and dogs. To cope with these problem behaviours owners can seek professional health, daycare arrangements or medications to relieve some of the stress the dog feels. These options are all helpful and all have their place. However, with steady incremental training, it is possible to train your dog to feel more confident when left alone.

                Your dog should complete all training without getting stressed. If training is causing your dog to be stressed then you may need to take smaller steps. Only by building positive associations can we start to make progress with training your dog that being alone is not scary! The following is the training plan we use to help owners train their dogs.

                Before you step out the door, we work on desensitisation to common triggers of anxiety these include:
              </p>
              <ul class="content is-medium">
                <li>Moving towards the door</li>
                <li>Putting shoes/coat on</li>
                <li>Picking up keys</li>
              </ul>
              <p
                class="is-medium content"
              >
                To do these actions are completed without leaving the house until the dog does not associate these actions with you leaving.
              </p>
              <p
                class="is-medium content"
              >
                Once you can prepare to leave without your dog getting stressed then we introduce leaving for short bursts. Depending on your dog's progress we develop custom sessions based on past training sessions to help them get the most out of the training sessions.
